# BengalBotsDiscordBot
Bot for the BengalBots Discord Server.

Apologies for the disorganization. This is my first ever repository and I'm not entirely familiar with setting stuff up with Discord. Hopefully my future repositories are more cleanly organized!

Also I'm just pasting files downloaded from AutoCode. (Major shoutout to them, they made building this bot REALLY straightforward.)
Here's a button for that.

Anyhow, feel free to check out the chaos either through the GitHub or the AutoCode profile!
